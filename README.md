# PureFTP GUI

This is a simple frontend for the PureFTPd-MySQL server made in Nodejs (use this for in-house stuff, but I think the basic version is good enough for personal use).

The admin control panel is based off ThemeKit, a Bootstrap 4 Admin Panel, found here: https://github.com/ThemeKit/BootstrapAdmin.

## How to Use
Open up dbcon.js to set your MySQL connection table.  You can run:

npm run installer

To create the PureFTPd compatible table.  Run npm start to run the program.
